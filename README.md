# Iso Block Editor Thing

This time in C++ using SDL3.

## Vector2
I'm just going to use an `array<float, 2>` to represent the vectors and implement the small vector math operations I require myself. It's lightweight and simple to think about. By convention `[0]` will represent the `x` and `y` will be represented by `[1]`.

## MonoGame Version
This is a rebuild of a [C#/MonoGame version that I've already done](https://github.com/MattDrivenDev/IsoBlockEditorThing/tree/csharp-monogame), so that I can continue to learn me some C++. You can see the "goal" app/game here:
